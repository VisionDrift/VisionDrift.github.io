	<p>You lay down on the couch and doze off hoping to pass the time until you the storm ends.</p>
	<p>During your slumber you feel what could be described as blankets being placed on you however you are too dormant to wake up and react. </p>
	<p>After a few hours you wake up and the storm has finally passed. You donâ€™t know who put these blankets on you and you can't see anyone else around, but at least you survived and leave the mansion intact.</p>
