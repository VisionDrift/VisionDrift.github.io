<h1>About VisionDrift!</h1>
<p>Hello, I am VisionDrift and I am an Artist.

I started getting into art during the latter half of high school where I got to work with the free 3D software called Blender where I was able to learn how to do simple 2d animations using a mouse instead of a pencil. I also learned that I preferred to work in 3D over the conventional 2D pen and paper because the software afforded me to not be worried about my drawing skills as much and more about how creative I want to be.

If you want to be an artist, I always say that you don't have to pick up a pencil and paper, because there are other ways to create art. You can do arts and crafts, pottery, blacksmithing, website development, video editing, pixel art, even knitting.

â€‹As long as you find what you're good at, which you will, nothing will stop the creativity from flowing and your vision from drifting.</p>
