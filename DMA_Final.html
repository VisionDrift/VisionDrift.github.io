<h1 style="text-align:center;">Hello this is the page for my Art 74 Final!</h1>
<br>
	
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Games as 3D Models</h2>
<img src="images/Shiori_Store.png" height="600" width="600" style="width:50%;">
<p style="text-align:center;">This final project for my Art 74 class at SJSU is meant to showcase the potential of video games as potential tools in 3D modeling by using Minecraft to produce usable 3d models for scenes made in Blender.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://skfb.ly/pEnHw">Visit the interable model!</a></p>
<br>
<b><h2 style="text-align:center;">Project Process:</h2></b>
<p style="text-align:center;">This section will explain in detail the work proces of producing this final product which is split into three areas.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The purpose behind this project was using the medium of video games like Minecraft as an unintentional model generation tool in Blender to create models and aesthetic art pieces.</p>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Tutorials</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">Before I began diving into working on my project, I looked up tutorials for builds, textures, and anything else that I wanted to include into my project and final product</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Watching these tutorials takes a lot of time depending on how long they are and for my project the longest video would be an hour or 2 long.</p>

<br>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Building and Modelings</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">Diving into actually working on the project, I had two workspaces, one in Minecraft where I built the tutorials I followed and using a 3rd party program Mineways I would export them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The second workspace is in Blender where I imported the builds from Minecraft then models an environment to showcase these builds which for this project was an antique shop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This part of the project took the most time because I was working while watching tutorials and the process would take several days to complete</p>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Render and Composition</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">Once everything was finished I then rendered and composed the project in Blender with simple lighting and built-in render engines in the program</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This was the quickest part of the project, but still took roughly half an hour to an hour to accomplish.</p>
